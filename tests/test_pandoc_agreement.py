"""What the toolkit thinks the document is, against what pandoc actually makes of it.

Two of the worst holes so far were disagreements with the renderer, not bugs in isolation:

* a `# Methods` comment inside a fenced listing became a heading, popped the real one, and
  let a fabricated `p < 0.001` in the Results pass as the pre-specified alpha;
* a setext heading underlined with two dashes was invisible, because the toolkit demanded
  three and pandoc accepts one — so Results content inherited the enclosing Methods chain.

Both were found by a person comparing the code against the CommonMark spec. Neither could
have been caught by a unit test of the regex, because the regex was self-consistent; what it
disagreed with was pandoc. So this asks pandoc directly, for every structural construct
worth arguing about, and fails when the two views differ.

The point is not that pandoc is a specification. It is that pandoc is *the thing that builds
the document the reader receives*, so where the toolkit and pandoc disagree about what is a
heading or what is code, the toolkit is wrong by definition.

    quotation is part of the thing being quoted, not a section of this paper. Recognising it
